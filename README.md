Pandas is a powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation. It provides two main data structures: Series, a one-dimensional labeled array, and DataFrame, a two-dimensional table with labeled rows and columns. With pandas, you can perform operations like data cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, reshaping, and statistical analysis.
